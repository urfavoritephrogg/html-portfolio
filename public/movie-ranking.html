<h1>The Best Movies Ever Created! (according to me)</h1>

<h2>My top 3 picks..</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<h4>5/5</h4>
<p>Action, Adventure, Revenge, it has literally everything, nothing else to say</p>

<br />

<h3>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse</h3>
<h4>4.5/5</h4>
<p>Beautiful art, scenery, and of course the best superhero (would be a 5/5 but the sequal waters it down)</p>

<br />

<h3>Top Gun Maverick</h3>
<h4>4/5</h4>
<p>Crazy Action and cool planes, had a panick attack halfway through</p>
